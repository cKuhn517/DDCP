,Conj,creation,acid,,,,,,6,Acid Fog,Fog deals acid damage.,vsmd,1 action,Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level),1 round/level,None,Yes,"A bank of fog billows out from the point the character designates. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has one-half concealment (attacks suffer a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). The fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at one-tenth normal speed, and all melee attack and melee damage rolls suffer a –2 penalty. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into the fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that the creature or objects passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6.

Each round, starting when the character casts the spell, the fog deals 2d6 points of acid damage to creatures and objects within it.

Only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.",,

,Trans,,,,4,,,,,Air Walk,Subject treads on air as if solid (climb at 45-degree angle).,vsd,1 action,Touch,10 minutes/level,None,Yes,"The target creature can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the creature's normal speed.

A strong wind (21+ mph) can push an air walker along or hold the walker back. At the end of the walker's turn each round, the wind blows the walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds.

The character can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. The character trains a mount to air walk with the Handle Animal skill (air walking counts as an unusual task).",,
,Abjur,,,1,,,,1,1,Alarm,Wards an area for 2 hours/level.,vsfd,1 action,Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels),2 hours/level,None,No,"Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the area or touches it. A creature who speaks the password (determined by the character at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. The character decides at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.

Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts the character (and only the character) so long as the character remains within a mile of the warded area. The character notes a single mental alert that awakens the character from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.

Audible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly up to 180 feet away. The ringing lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing.

Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the alarm unless the intruder becomes material while in the warded area.",,
,Trans,,,,,,,,2,Alter Self,"As change self, plus more drastic changes.",vs,1 action,Personal,10 minutes/level,--,--,"The character can alter the character's appearance and form-including clothing and equipment-to appear taller or shorter, thin, fat, or in between. The assumed form must be corporeal. The character's body can undergo a limited physical transmutation, including adding or subtracting one or two limbs, and the character's weight can be changed up to one-half. If the form selected has wings, the character can fly at a speed of 30 feet with poor maneuverability. If the form has gills, the character can breathe underwater.

The character's attack rolls, natural armor bonus, and saves do not change. The spell does not confer special abilities, attack forms, defenses, ability scores, or mannerisms of the chosen form. Once the new form is chosen, it remains for the duration of the spell. If the character is slain, the character automatically returns to the character's normal form.

If the character uses this spell to create a disguise, the character gets a +10 bonus on the character's Disguise check.",,
,Div,,,,,,,,6,Analyze Dweomer,Reveals magical aspects of subject.,vsf,8 hours,Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels),1 round/level,See text,No,"The character discerns spells and magical properties present in a creature or object. One property, spell, or power is revealed each round, from lowest level (or weakest power) to highest (or strongest). For each spell or power, the character makes a caster level check (1d20 + caster level). If the result is equal to or higher than the spell's or power's caster level, the character identifies it. Otherwise, the character fails to identify that spell or power, and the character can check for the next one next round.

Analyze dweomer does not function when used on an artifact.

After the character analyzes one object or creature, the spell ends, even if its duration has not expired yet. The character must make a Fortitude save (DC 21) when the spell ends or be exhausted and unable to do anything but rest for the next 1d8 hours.

Focus: The focus must be worth at least 1,500 gp.",,

The spell does not enable the character to control the charmed person as if the person were an automaton, but the subject perceives the character's words and actions in the most favorable way. The character can try to give the subject orders, but the character must win an opposed Charisma check to convince the subject to do anything he or she wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries not allowed.) A charmed person never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by the character or the character's apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell.

Distance is not a factor, but the locale must be known—a place familiar to the character or an obvious one. The spell does not allow magically enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, the character sees nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, the character can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell’s effect.

5 or more: Stunned for 1 round.

    1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.
    2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the strength of the strongest aura.
    3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, the character can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras.

Aura Strength: An aura’s magical power and strength depend on a spell’s functioning spell level or an item’s caster level.
Functioning
Spell Level  Item
Caster Level  Aura
Strength
0-level or lingering
aura  Lingering aura  Dim
1st-3rd  1st-5th  Faint
4th-6th  6th-11th  Moderate
7th-9th  12th-20th  Strong
Artifact or deity-level
magic  Beyond mortal caster  Overwhelming

If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

Length Aura Lingers: How long the aura lingers depends on its original strength:
Aura Strength  Duration
Faint                 1d6 minutes
Moderate          1d6 X 10 minutes
Strong              1d6 hours
Overwhelming  1d6 days

Note: Each round, the character can turn to detect things in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are conjured, the conjuration spell registers.",,

The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while objects wielded or employed by creatures receive a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, the gear vanishes, too. If the character casts the spell on someone else, neither the character nor the character's allies can see the subject, unless the character can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.

Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.

The subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an ""attack"" includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character’s perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. If the subject attacks directly it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Note that spells such that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.",,

,,,,2,,,,,2,Mirror Image,"Creates decoy duplicates of you (1d4 +1/three levels, max 8).",vs,1 action,Personal,1 minute/level,--,--,"Several illusory duplicates of the character pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near the character and disappear when struck.

Mirror image creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images). These figments separate from the character and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or the character. The character can move into and through a mirror image. When the character and the mirror image separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is the character and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic the character's actions.

Enemies attempting to attack the character or cast spells at the character must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack roll against a figment destroys it. A figment's AC is 10 + size modifier + Dexterity modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells.

While moving, the character can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded.

An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If the character is invisible or an attacker shuts her eyes, the spell has no effect, though being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded: In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus to attackers' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a –4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skills.",,

(Roll on the table below to see what sort of creature is summoned.) A creature in the swarm who takes no actions other than fighting off the swarming creatures takes 1 point of damage on its turn. A creature in the swarm who takes any other action, including leaving the swarm, takes 1d4 points of damage +1 point per three caster levels. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the swarm is impossible.
1d20  Swarm Type*
1-8  Rats (animals)
9-14  Bats (animals)
15-16  Spiders (vermin, poisonous)
17-18  Centipedes (vermin, poisonous)
19-20  Flying beetles (vermin)
* The creature types (in parentheses) indicate what sorts of spells and effects might aid a subject against the swarm.

A swarm of poisonous creatures deals no damage to creatures who are immune to poison, though it still prevents spellcasting and concentration. The creatures’ attacks are nonmagical. Damage reduction, being incorporeal, and other special abilities also make a creature immune to damage from the swarm.

The swarm cannot be fought effectively with weapons, but fire and damaging area effects can force it to disperse. The swarm disperses when it has taken a total of 2 hit points of damage per caster level from these attacks. Certain area or effect spells disperse a swarm immediately if appropriate to the swarm summoned.

The swarm is stationary once summoned. A druid caster, however, can (as a move-equivalent action) direct the swarm to move up to 30 feet per round (or 90 feet per round if the druid has summoned bats or beetles).",,

These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web or simply touching its strands become entangled among the gluey fibers.

An entangled creature suffers a –2 penalty to attack rolls, suffers a –4 penalty to effective Dexterity, and can’t move. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check (DC 15) or lose the spell.

Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the webs and is free to act, though moving may be a problem (see below). If the save fails, the creature is stuck. A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding at a Strength check (DC 20) or an Escape Artist check (DC 25). Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature may progress through the web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.

The web provides one-quarter cover for every 5 feet of the substance between the character and an opponent—one-half cover for 10 feet of web, three-quarters for 15 feet, and total cover for 20 feet or more.

The strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set them alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of damage from the flames.",,
